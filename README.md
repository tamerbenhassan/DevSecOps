# DevSecOps for SpringBoot Application
Overview
This project showcases a DevSecOps pipeline for a SpringBoot application, emphasizing security integration throughout the development lifecycle. Utilizing Jenkins for CI/CD and deploying on Kubernetes clusters hosted on Azure VMs, the project incorporates a broad array of tools and practices to ensure security and compliance from development to production.

# Tools and Technologies
## Jenkins
Facilitates automated builds, testing, and deployments, integrating security checks at every step of the CI/CD pipeline.

## Kubernetes on Azure VM
Provides a scalable and secure environment for deploying containerized applications, leveraging Kubernetes' orchestration capabilities.

## Istio Service Mesh
Manages, secures, and observes network communications between services, enhancing security and operability within the microservices architecture.

## Kiali
Offers visibility into the Istio service mesh, providing insights into the microservices' performance, configuration, and security.

## Prometheus & Grafana
Used for monitoring and visualizing the application's operational and security metrics, aiding in proactive vulnerability management.

## Falco
Detects and alerts on anomalous activities in real-time, enhancing the security monitoring capabilities within the Kubernetes ecosystem.

## OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP)
ZAP is employed for DAST, automatically finding security vulnerabilities in your web applications while you are developing and testing your applications.

## SonarQube
SonarQube is used for SAST, scrutinizing code quality and security vulnerabilities within the application source code, ensuring adherence to coding standards and security best practices.

## Open Policy Agent (OPA)
Enforces security policies and best practices across the Kubernetes clusters, ensuring compliance with organizational and regulatory standards.

## Center for Internet Security (CIS) Benchmarking
Ensures the Kubernetes configuration adheres to CIS benchmarks, promoting a secure and compliant infrastructure setup.

## OWASP
The project aligns with OWASP Top Ten, integrating practices and tools to safeguard against prevalent web application security threats.

## Trivy, KubeSec, Kube-Bench
These tools are integral for scanning vulnerabilities in containers, Kubernetes configurations, and ensuring compliance with the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.

## DevSecOps Practices
Incorporating advanced practices and tools, this project achieves a high level of security:

### Continuous Security: 
Integrating security into the continuous integration and deployment processes, ensuring every build is tested for vulnerabilities.
### Automated Security Scanning: 
Utilizing ZAP for dynamic analysis and SonarQube for static code analysis, enabling early detection and remediation of vulnerabilities.
### Policy as Code: 
Applying OPA to enforce security and operational policies, ensuring consistent compliance across all environments.
###Compliance and Monitoring: 
Employing Prometheus, Grafana, and Falco for monitoring, along with CIS benchmarking for infrastructure compliance, maintains high security and operational standards.
